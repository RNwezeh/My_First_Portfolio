            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>My name is Rosequeen Nwezeh. I am a technical assistant to an executive director transitioning into a software Engineering. I started my academic journey with a degree in Geology, but my career path evolved as I developed a strong interest in business operations. I acquired a PGD and MBA in Finance and investment and also got a job as an administrative officer where I gained some practical skills in sales operations while completing some online administrative and operations management courses, which enabled me to step into my current role as a Technical Assistant to an Executive Director.</p>
